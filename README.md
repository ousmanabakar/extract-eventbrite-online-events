# ‚ú® About Extract Eventbrite online events scraper ‚ú®

Eventbrite did not provide an API specifically designed for extracting online events. Extracting event data from Eventbrite usually requires some coding knowledge and API integration.

Fortunately, there is a tool called Apify that offers a solution for extracting the latest online events from Eventbrite without the need for coding. Apify is a web scraping and automation platform that simplifies the process of extracting data from websites.

With the help of an Apify script, users can retrieve event information from Eventbrite, including online events. The script is designed to navigate through Eventbrite's website, locate the relevant event data, and extract it for further use. This eliminates the need for users to manually browse through Eventbrite or write custom code to fetch the data.

The extracted event data can be downloaded in various formats, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), or Excel. These formats enable easy analysis and manipulation of the event information. Additionally, the extracted data can be used for custom workflows, which allows users to integrate the information into their own systems or processes.

Apify provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to configure and run the script without requiring extensive programming skills. By automating the data extraction process, Apify simplifies the task of finding and gathering the latest online events from Eventbrite, making it more accessible to a wider range of users.
